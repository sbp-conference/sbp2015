                        <b>Abstract: </b><br />
                        Due to the pervasive adoption of the ubiquitous cloud, distributive grid and mobile computing, data collection has grown exponentially in every industry, research area, and government sector. Making sense and managing the life cycle of big data becomes a very complex topic. For instance, the use of Web 2.0 technologies and applications, in particular social media, has efficiently gathered a large volume of timely feedback and opinions from a diverse, global population (Fan and Gordon, 2014). In fact, data about people, their behaviors and communications, and the events they experience can be processed and used to detect population trends, predict behavior and inform decisions (Ribarsky et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2012). This tutorial will introduce participants to Splunk, a commercial software tool used to search, monitor and analyze big data, to give participants an opportunity to engage with data analytical tools and complete hands-on exercises. The hands-on exercises will start with an introduction to an experimental big data set, followed by a discussion about the nature of data and some analysis perspectives and techniques. These exercises will allow participants to identify and quantify the domains of specific research areas (e.g., anonymized healthcare, social, or business data) using a “big data” set that addresses their research questions. Participants will be placed in groups where they will perform an analysis on a prepared data set. Each group will have a different analytical focus. This analysis will require participants to parse out probable variables and make comparison and inference about users’ behavioral patterns and/or motivation models as displayed by actors collectively. Participants will be invited to demonstrate their findings and share their views after the completion of these hands-on exercises.

In particular, she is interested in investigating the range of motives that drive online users to seek and exchange information, the interaction dynamics shaped by these networked environments, and the economic and business consequences of the informational and social value derived from such behavior. She is also interested in applying specifically information visualization to research into library studies to improve patron engagement, collection management, and resource allocation.

                        <b>Abstract: </b><br />
                        This tutorial will introduce audience members to the basics of social network analysis and unsupervised text analysis methods. Topics covered include sources of network data, social network metrics, and an overview of text analysis techniques that can be used to perform computational social science. Students will gain experience using a range of social network analysis techniques, and exposure to machine learning and statistical algorithms that can be used to perform in-depth analysis.

                    <p>
                        Specifically, we will provide an introduction to basic natural language processing algorithms such as Latent Semantic Analysis and Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Detailed examples from the instructor’s research in the Food and Drug Administration will be provided.

                    <h3>Behavioral Mining, Cultural Differences and Social Network Analysis in Massive Online Games</h3>
                    <p>
                        <b>Abstract:</b><br />
                        Massive Online Games (MOGs) refer to massive online persistent environments (World of Warcraft, EVE Online, EverQuest etc) shared by millions of people . In general these environments are characterized by a rich array of activities and social interactions with a wide array of behaviors e.g., cooperation, trade, quest, deceit, mentoring etc. Such environments allow one to study human behavior at a level of granularity where it was not possible to do so previously. Given the challenges associated with analyzing this type of data traditional techniques in data mining and social network analysis have to be extended with insights from the social sciences. The tutorial will cover predictive and generative models in the study of MOGs. Additionally we will cover some SNA techniques which are more appropriate for MOGs given the multi-dimensionality of the data (P*/ERGM Models, IR Based Network Analysis, Hypergrah based Techniques, Coextensive Social Networks etc). Based on our published work in this area we also describe the various ways in which MOGs exhibit similarities to the real world e.g., economic behaviors, clandestine behaviors, mentoring etc). Lastly we describe the scope and limitations of analysis of MOGs based on limitations in data collection, availability and ethical concerns. An overview of differences in human behavior between Chinese and American MMOs is also given.

                        I introduce the effective collection, organization and exploration of spatial data (maps) and social network data to social scientists. Detailed templates in Python and R will be shared that automate the processes mentioned above. A particular emphasis will be given to data collected from the web, the visualization of data in networks and/or maps. I finally present steps for publication of reports via the tools offered in Python (IPython and Github) and R (RStudio, Github and RPubs), including brief explanations on how interact with UCINET, Gephi, Netlogo and QGIS.

                    <h3>Introduction to Dynamic Network Analysis</h3>
                    <p>
                        <b>Abstract:</b><br/> 
                        We discuss dynamic network analysis and how it can be useful both for instantiating simulations and for novel simulation outputs. The tutorial focuses on providing attendees grounding in network analysis, allowing attendees to incorporate network data as inputs or as outcomes of their simulation tools. We first introduce key network analysis concepts and statistics including centrality measures and brokerage. To ground these concepts and provide some intuition for thinking about different types of centrality measures, we run a short hands-on analysis of network data in ORA based on intelligence from the Revolutionary War. We then introduce the data structures commonly used in network analysis and help attendees import their own data into ORA. We then introduce attendees to grouping algorithms including clique identification, Concor, and Newman-Girvan. We conclude with additional methodologies to compare networks such as QAP. These methods are particularly useful for comparing simulation inputs and outputs, and inform analysis of simulation outputs. Attendees are encouraged to bring their own data, but sample data will be provided.
